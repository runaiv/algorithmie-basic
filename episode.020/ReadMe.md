There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```
1 = wink 10 = double blink 100 = close your eyes 1000 = jump

10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.
